### .pact Files:

The .pact files contain the source code of Pact smart contracts.
They are written in the Pact programming language, which is a functional smart contract language designed specifically for blockchain applications.
.pact files are typically created and edited using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
These files contain the contract logic, including the contract definition, functions, data types, and any associated code.

### .repl Files:

The .repl files are used for interacting with Pact contracts through the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) environment.
REPL is an interactive environment where you can execute Pact commands and interact with contracts deployed on a Pact server.
.repl files contain a series of Pact commands that can be executed sequentially in the REPL.
The commands in .repl files can include operations like deploying a contract, calling contract functions, and retrieving contract data.
.repl files are often used for automating contract interactions or for scripting complex interactions with Pact contracts.
Both .pact and .repl files are essential for developing and deploying Pact smart contracts. The .pact files contain the contract source code, while the .repl files provide a way to interact with deployed contracts and automate interactions for testing and deployment purposes.
